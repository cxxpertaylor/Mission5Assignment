            so that I could talk with my dad and brother about them. 
            Over the years, we have grown very close because of our mutual love for this series.
            Talking about the books is just as fun as reading them.
            I also love these books because they helped me become friends with my wife. 
            One of the first times that we hung out, I saw the first book on her shelf and asked about it. 
            She had actually read it and loved it! This definitely contributed to my decision to marry her.</p>

            The Stormlight Archive takes place on the world of Roshar, a planet afflicted by regular cataclysms known as "highstorms", 
            which have shaped the land and people. Mysterious spirits known as "spren" interact with mankind and give them magical abilities.
